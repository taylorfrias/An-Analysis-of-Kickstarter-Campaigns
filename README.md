## An analysis of Kickstarted campaign based on goals and launch date.
The data fully supports that Louise chose a good goal and time to start funding for her play, Fever. ---

Looking at the data set, play’s that have a lower goal have a higher chance of success. Louise’s goal of $2,885 had a 69% probability of funding when looking at other plays whose goal ranged between $1,000 to $4,999. Giving her only a 31% chance of failure.  The data set of course has its limitations. We cannot take in consideration, people’s preferences’ when it comes to certain plays. Maybe people didn’t like the theme of her play which is why she didn’t get the funding needed to reach her goal. Or maybe there wasn’t enough time to reach her goal. ---

Louise began her Kickstarted in June 2016. Looking at the data as a whole she had a success rate of 70%, showing that she chose the best month to start funding for her Kickstarter. However, filtering the data set to only show 2016 you can see the percentage of success fall to 59%. June 2016 had the lowest success rate. This shows you that even when we forecast data, data can always change. Looking at the average Louise chose the best time to start however due changes in people unforeseen changes June 2016 ended up being the wrong time to start a Kickstarter.
To improvise on this study, we can look into marketing data. Looking to see how successful Kickstarters marketed their product. This would show if there was enough marketing done to reach their goals and through what resources. Maybe her play failed since there wasn’t enough buzz around her play. With this data
In conclusion the majority of Kickstarters who had a low goal, below $5000 and who started their kickstarted in June had a high probability of succeeding. There are always going to be outliers and limitations to all data which could prevent someone from accurately forecasting future results.
